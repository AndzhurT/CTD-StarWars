# Star Wars API Explorer
This is a simple web application that allows users to explore data from the Star Wars API (https://www.swapi.tech/).

**Overview** 
---
The application consists of three pages: Home, Characters, and Planets. Each page displays a list of items (characters and planets) that can be clicked to view more details about that item. The details are displayed in a popup window.

The data is fetched from the Star Wars API using JavaScript fetch requests. The data is then parsed and displayed in the appropriate HTML elements using JavaScript.

**Usage**
---
To use the application, simply open the starwars.html(HTML/starwars.html) file in a web browser. From there, you can navigate to the different pages using the navigation bar at the top of the screen. 

**Dependencies**
---
The application requires an internet connection to fetch data from the Star Wars API. 

**Additional Info**
---
If some features do not work, such as CSS styling of a page, JS functions, or the page does not open up when you click on it in the navigation bar, open all the files so it can load (including photos). After loading the files, you should be able to close files, and everything should work correctly.
