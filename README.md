# Star Wars API Explorer
This is a simple web application that allows users to explore data from the Star Wars API (https://www.swapi.tech/).

**Overview** 
---
The application consists of three pages: Home, Characters, and Planets. Each page displays a list of items (characters and planets) that can be clicked to view more details about that item. The details are displayed in a popup window.

The data is fetched from the Star Wars API using JavaScript fetch requests. The data is then parsed and displayed in the appropriate HTML elements using JavaScript.

**Usage**
---
To use the application, simply open the starwars.html(HTML/starwars.html) file in a web browser. From there, you can navigate to the different pages using the navigation bar at the top of the screen. 

**Dependencies**
---
The application requires an internet connection to fetch data from the Star Wars API.
